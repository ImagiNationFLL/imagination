* Two diffrent aps for dog and owner.
* Whistle: is a collar that you put on your dog and if your dog runs away you get a email and it brings you to a map with a picture of your do wherever it is
* Train your dog to respond to serten sounds that you make by the app on your phone
  * for example if your dog gets lost you push a button that says "My dogs gone,I need help"
* The app is called (Find your dog .com.
* our app should have 2 buttons and one of those buttons will say "speak" and the other one will say "dog" the one that says speak means if you press it then you can say something to your dog. if the button says dog then that means if you press it then your dog will speak to you.
* The app will show you were your dog is and tells you if your dog ran away or got lost and how far it has gone and how long it has not been away from your house.

* the app should tell us if it is really close like at your neighbors house,or if it is really far away. If it is very far away.................STEP ON IT!!!!!!!!
* IF your dog is lost there will be a sound that means its lost and not at it right home.
  * For example if your dog runs away then maybe we could make it so your phone vibrates and that means that your owner will knoe that there dog has ran away.
* You phone will make a sound to tell you that your dog is missing and not at home when it  makes a sound  you klick a butten that tells you the information .
* if your dog gets worried or gets wild the app tells the nearest person that that dog has gone missing if the perso does not do any thing it will tell some one elas.
