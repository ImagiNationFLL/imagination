     Our project is about helping people find their dogs, and finding a better way for search and rescue dogs to communicate with their owners. There are some ways that already exist of finding dogs, but ours will be much more efficent and easy to use. There will be an app that will let you send short, easy messages to your dogs. Right now, search and rescue dogs can be tracked, but efficent equippment is pretty expensive. Our version would have more advanced communications that can send messages that the dog would be trained to respond to. For instance, a clicking sound could mean, "come back" and a certain beep could mean, "continue searching."
