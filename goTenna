Hi goTenna, we are a FLL team. FLL is a STEM program for kids 8-14. This year our project is about improving interactions between people and animals. Our idea is a collar for tracking/communicating with dogs efficiently and effectively. We think that we could combine our idea and your technology to make a new product for dog owners. We have discovered that one of the main reasons many people don't buy dog tracking devices is that you have to pay for the connection. With your technology, we could create a dog tracker that doesn't. This new product would be able to let the owner know where the dog is and send messages/sounds to the dog that they could understand. We would be very happy if you could reply.
