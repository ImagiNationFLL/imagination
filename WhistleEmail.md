Hi, we are Imagi-Nation, a First Lego League (FLL) team. FLL is a STEM program for elementary through middle. We are interested in your app and collar because our theme for our science project is trying to make a different app and collar, execpt we want to make a version of it that is for search and rescue dogs in addition to normal pets that will help you find your pet. We are contacting you about this because we we want to know what other technology you have in your app and collar. We would like to try to add on to your collar and improve it. Once we are done with our project, the idea would be yours to do whatever you wanted to with it. We have downloaded your app and are making a similar program that isn't operational yet. We are also reseaching the design of your collars to make a prototype. Please send us the info on how Whistle works. We look forward to working with Whistle. 

P.S We aren't trying to take your idea, just add on to it.
