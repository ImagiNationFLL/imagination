Hello, we are a STEM team that is interested in your GPS pet tracker. We are curious about this because our project this year is about improving the interaction between animals and people. We wanted to contact you because it would be incredibly helpful to us if we could work with you and learn about how your product works. The idea we have includes many of the things that are in your product. So if you could help us learn your process of making your product and the thoughts behind it, it would be tremendously helpful for our future endeavors. We would like to learn about how you made your app because it would help us with our app that we were trying to make ourselves. With help from your company, it would speed the project tenfold. We also would like to learn how you built your tracker so we could use those straegies ourself,if given permissiom. With your help, we could create something that could help bridge the gap between human and dog interaction.
