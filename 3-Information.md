Lila: Our project is about helping people find their dogs, and finding a better way for search and rescue dogs to communicate with their owners.

 Anna: There are some ways that already exist of finding dogs, but ours will be much more efficent and easy to use. In addition to GPS tracking, there will be an app that will let you send short, simple messages to your dogs.

Aman: Right now, search and rescue dogs can be tracked, but efficient equipment is pretty expensive. Our version would have more advanced communications that can send messages that the dog would be trained to respond to.

Cindy: For instance, a clicking sound could mean, "come back" and a certain beep could mean, "continue searching." The app would also keep track of how far away the dog is.

Quinn: We talked to a Maryland search and rescue dog team about the quality of communication between dogs and their owners. 

Leighanna: We also sent an e-mail to the company Whistle explaining our product idea. Whistle is a company that makes dog trackers. They have not yet replied to our e-mail.
 
Reid: We also have talked to many people who own dogs and may benefit from this idea.

Roger: Our product would be inexpensive and easy to use.

Heidi: We hope that with this product and a good training program we can make a difference in many dogâ€™s life.
